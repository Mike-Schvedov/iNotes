# Just a simple notes app used in my tutorials. <br>Add notes to Room Database, display them on a recyclerview, and delete them as well.<br>

## The project contains different branches for each stage of development:<br>
**Initial** - The way the project was at the beginning of the turorial. No MVVM, and not functional at all.<br>
**WithMVVM** - The Project after we added MVVM. It is fully operational, as seen in the attached images. (Without Dependency Injection)<br>
(will be added - With Dependency Injection, and MVVM)<br>
(will be added - With a Home Screnn Widget, Showing the list on your home screen)<br>
